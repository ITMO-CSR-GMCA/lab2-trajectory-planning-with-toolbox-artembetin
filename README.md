> In this lab, we went through the full simulation process of a UR5 robot arm using the Python Robotics Toolbox:
 + First, the robot model is initialized and the kinematic parameters are set based on the results of Lab 1.
 + Then, we configure a random starting pose and solve the forward kinematics problem to determine the terminal position.
 + The workspace of the robot is constructed by sampling joint configurations within a given range
 + A specific point in the workspace is selected and the inverse kinematics problem is solved to find the corresponding joint configuration.
 + Next, we plan the motion between the initial and final pose using three methods: jtraj, mtraj(quintic), and mtraj(trapezoidal).
 + The results are visualized through graphs of position, velocity and acceleration of each joint.
> Joint-space trajectories were plotted for position, velocity, and acceleration, revealing that jtraj and the quintic profile yield very smooth motion with continuous acceleration, whereas LSPBâ€™s trapezoidal profile introduces acceleration jumps that reduce smoothness but simplify implementation. Overall, the exercise clarified how different trajectory generators affect motion quality and control effort in robotic manipulators.
